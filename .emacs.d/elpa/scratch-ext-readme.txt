scratch-ext.el is extensions for *scratch* buffer.

This enables you to dump *scratch* buffer automatically
when it is killed or Emacs quits.

In addition,
* killing *scratch* becomes simply (erase-buffer) it.
  So you can easily undo it.
* After you save *scratch* to file by hand, new *scratch* buffer is created.
