# dot-files
Repo to keep my dotfiles


DO NOT COPY!

You can use these setting files but never copy-paste them!

The following applications need to be installed:

* vim-gtk
* tmux
* git
* zsh
* tmuxinator
* cmatrix
* LS
* eclimd (not needed, may need cleaning up)
* virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper
* (there might be some I'm missing, those are too obvious)

Run installation for fonts, emacs elpa thingys and oh-my-zsh powerline
